# Revenue Forecasting Model

This project builds a regression model to predict monthly revenue for a retail company based on internal marketing spend and external unemployment rate.

## Objective
To understand how marketing effectiveness varies with economic conditions, and forecast future revenue using a multiple regression model with an interaction term.

## Project Goals

- Forecast monthly revenue based on internal and external indicators.
- Analyze how marketing effectiveness changes in different economic climates.
- Provide a data-driven approach for budgeting and planning.
- Create a reusable regression model in R with clean, visual outputs.
